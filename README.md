# myrepo

This is my personal repository for all my personal projects.

This repo contains a simple project I had written while taking session on Python-SQL connection for ILP associates.

The objective was to use sqlite3 python libraries to create a dummy DB and students table with pre written entries.
Write a python code that will connect to this DB and run aggregation SQL queries that will display the values on the console based on the selection made by the user.
